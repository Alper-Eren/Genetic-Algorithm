## Text classification with genetic algorithm
# Introduction
Text classification is an important topic in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, with applications such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, document categorization, and more.

The objective of this project is to develop an efficient and effective text classification model that can differentiate between positive and negative sentiments in a specific dataset, and to analyze it according to the project requirements.

## Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Text Classification
Genetic algorithms (GA) are a family of optimization techniques inspired by the process of natural selection. They have been successfully applied to various optimization problems, including text classification. In this project, we use a genetic algorithm to optimize the selection of words that can effectively classify the sentiment of text.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of text and corresponding sentiment labels. The sentiment labels are binary, with a label of 0 indicating the negative class and a label of 1 indicating the positive class. Our genetic algorithm-based approach evolves a word list over multiple generations to optimize the classification accuracy.

# Results
Throughout this project, we implemented a text classification model based on a genetic algorithm using the Python programming language and relevant libraries to analyze a specific dataset. Leveraging the power of genetic algorithms, our aim was to optimize the selection of relevant words that can distinguish between positive and negative sentiment classes.

## Impact of Hyperparameter Variations on Genetic Algorithm Performance
Genetic algorithms are an effective optimization technique that can be applied to various tasks, including text classification. In this study, we investigated the effects of two key hyperparameters, namely the length of the word list (N) and the population size (population_size), on the performance of a genetic algorithm-based text classification model.

## Discussion of Findings
Our analysis explored the impact of hyperparameters such as the length of the word list (N) and the population size (population_size) on the performance of the genetic algorithm. The findings indicate a trade-off between the level of detail in word list representation (N) and the computational complexity of the genetic algorithm. Similarly, a balance needs to be struck between population diversity (population_size) and the computational requirements of the optimization process.
